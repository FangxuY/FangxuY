Hi there 👋



- 🔭 I’m currently a senior student at XMU, and my major is computer science. I am going to study for my master degree at HKUST MSc(IT) program in 2021.
- 🌱 I currently have two internship experiences. 
- ☀️ The first internship is working as a data analysis intern in China's largest engineering consulting company.
- ⛄ the second internship is working as a test and development intern in Alibaba Group’s Alibaba Cloud Intelligence Business Group.
- 👯 I’m not sure what I'm going to do in the future, I really find a job that I do love. So I decide to try different jobs while I'm still young. 
- 🤔 Maybe I will be an algorithm job in the future, or maybe I will be a barista in the future. Who knows?
